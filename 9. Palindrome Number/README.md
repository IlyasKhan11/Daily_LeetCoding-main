# 9. Palindrome Number




link:https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same forward and backward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not
Example1:
```bash
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

```

Example2:
```bash
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```



Constraints:

```bash

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

```

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?






Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
