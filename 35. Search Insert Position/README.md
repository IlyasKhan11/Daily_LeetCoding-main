# 35. Search Insert Position







Link:https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description/

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity
 
Example1:
```bash
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2


```

Example2:
```bash
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4



```



Constraints:

```bash
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= target <= 104
```
